# lacelogg-swift
my own idea of the app named lacelogg written in Swift 3 for the Ios Course using GPS tools, SQLlite.swift, FacebookCore and FacebookLogin frameworks.

This app should make a camping for the limited sneakers much easier. You can register your account for a limited pair only if your are near sneaker shop, which have this pair for sale. If you are not near the shop anymore after x period of time your reservation will be removed, so another person can register for this limited offer.
